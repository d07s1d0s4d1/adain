# Adaptive Instance Normalization

This repository implements the idea of transferring the style described in the article:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06868.pdf

The authors propose a method that allows transferring not only styles that were present in the training set, but also those that were not previously observed. It is proposed to do this using encoder-decoder architecture with pretrained encoder and a new layer AdaIN, which is described in the article.
